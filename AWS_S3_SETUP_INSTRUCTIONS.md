# AWS S3 Setup Instructions (via IAM Dashboard)

Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up AWS S3 for your Fuel Logbook app without using the AWS CLI.

## Important: Signed URLs for Security

This app uses **signed URLs** to securely access private S3 objects. This means:
- âœ… Your S3 bucket remains completely private (no public access needed)
- âœ… Receipts are accessed via temporary URLs that expire after 1 hour
- âœ… Only your app can generate these secure URLs
- âœ… No "Access Denied" errors when viewing receipts

**You do NOT need to make your bucket public or configure CORS for basic receipt viewing.**

---

## Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket

1. **Log in to AWS Console**
   - Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/
   - Sign in with your AWS account credentials

2. **Navigate to S3**
   - In the search bar at the top, type "S3"
   - Click on "S3" from the results

3. **Create a New Bucket**
   - Click the orange "Create bucket" button
   - **Bucket name**: Enter a unique name (e.g., `fuel-logbook-receipts-yourname`)
     - Must be globally unique across all AWS accounts
     - Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
   - **AWS Region**: Choose your preferred region (e.g., `af-south-1` for Cape Town)
   - **Object Ownership**: Keep "ACLs disabled (recommended)"
   - **Block Public Access**: Keep all checkboxes CHECKED (block all public access)
     - âœ… This is correct - the app uses signed URLs, not public access
   - **Bucket Versioning**: Disable (optional, can enable if you want version history)
   - **Default encryption**: Enable with "Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)"
   - Click "Create bucket" at the bottom

## Step 2: Create an IAM User for Programmatic Access

1. **Navigate to IAM**
   - In the AWS Console search bar, type "IAM"
   - Click on "IAM" (Identity and Access Management)

2. **Create a New User**
   - In the left sidebar, click "Users"
   - Click the "Create user" button
   - **User name**: Enter `fuel-logbook-s3-user`
   - Click "Next"

3. **Set Permissions**
   - Select "Attach policies directly"
   - Click "Create policy" (opens in new tab)

### Create Custom Policy (Recommended for Security)

In the new tab:

1. Click the **"JSON"** tab
2. **Delete** the existing JSON
3. **Paste** this policy (replace `YOUR-BUCKET-NAME` with your actual bucket name):

\`\`\`json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "ReceiptManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/receipts/*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "ListBucket",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME",
      "Condition": {
        "StringLike": {
          "s3:prefix": "receipts/*"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

**Important**: This policy includes `s3:GetObject` which is required for generating signed URLs.

4. Click **"Next"**
5. **Policy name**: `FuelLogbookS3Policy`
6. **Description**: "Allows receipt upload, viewing (via signed URLs), and deletion"
7. Click **"Create policy"**

### Attach Policy to User

1. Go back to the previous tab (Create user page)
2. Click the **refresh icon** next to the policy search box
3. Search for **"FuelLogbookS3Policy"**
4. âœ… Check the box next to your policy
5. Click **"Next"**
6. Review and click **"Create user"**

**Alternative (Less Secure)**: You can use `AmazonS3FullAccess` for testing, but the custom policy above is more secure for production.

## Step 3: Create Access Keys

1. **Access the User**
   - Click on the newly created user `fuel-logbook-s3-user`

2. **Create Access Key**
   - Click on the "Security credentials" tab
   - Scroll down to "Access keys" section
   - Click "Create access key"
   - Select "Application running outside AWS"
   - Check the confirmation checkbox
   - Click "Next"
   - (Optional) Add a description tag: "Fuel Logbook App"
   - Click "Create access key"

3. **Save Your Credentials**
   - **IMPORTANT**: Copy both values immediately:
     - **Access key ID**: (looks like `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`)
     - **Secret access key**: (looks like `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`)
   - Click "Download .csv file" to save them securely
   - **WARNING**: You cannot retrieve the secret access key again after closing this dialog!
   - Click "Done"

## Step 4: Add Environment Variables to Vercel

1. **Go to Your Vercel Project**
   - Open https://vercel.com/
   - Navigate to your Fuel Logbook project
   - Click on "Settings" tab
   - Click on "Environment Variables" in the left sidebar

2. **Add the Following Variables**:

   **Variable 1:**
   - Name: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - Value: [Paste your Access key ID from Step 3]
   - Environment: Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click "Save"

   **Variable 2:**
   - Name: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - Value: [Paste your Secret access key from Step 3]
   - Environment: Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click "Save"

   **Variable 3:**
   - Name: `AWS_REGION`
   - Value: `af-south-1` (or your chosen region)
   - Environment: Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click "Save"

   **Variable 4:**
   - Name: `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`
   - Value: [Your bucket name from Step 1]
   - Environment: Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click "Save"

3. **Redeploy Your Application**
   - Go to the "Deployments" tab
   - Click the three dots on the latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - This ensures the new environment variables are loaded

## Step 5: Test the Integration

### Test Receipt Upload

1. Open your deployed Fuel Logbook app
2. Add a new fuel entry
3. Upload a receipt image (JPEG or PNG)
4. You should see: âœ… "Receipt uploaded to AWS S3"

### Test Receipt Viewing (Signed URLs)

1. Go to your fuel log dashboard
2. Find an entry with a receipt
3. Click "View Receipt"
4. The receipt should open in a new tab
5. **Note**: The URL will be a signed URL that expires after 1 hour

### Verify in S3 Console

1. Go to [AWS S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Click on your bucket
3. Navigate to the `receipts/` folder
4. You should see uploaded files with `.avif` extension

## Understanding Signed URLs

### What Are Signed URLs?

Signed URLs are temporary, secure links generated by your app that allow access to private S3 objects.

### How It Works in Your App

1. **Upload**: Receipt is uploaded to private S3 bucket
2. **Storage**: S3 URL (without signature) is saved in database
3. **Viewing**: When you click "View Receipt", the app:
   - Extracts the S3 key from the stored URL
   - Generates a signed URL valid for 1 hour
   - Returns the signed URL to your browser
4. **Access**: Browser opens the signed URL to view the receipt
5. **Expiration**: After 1 hour, the URL expires

### Benefits

- âœ… **Security**: Bucket remains private, no public access
- âœ… **Temporary**: URLs expire automatically
- âœ… **Controlled**: Only your app can generate signed URLs
- âœ… **No CORS needed**: For basic viewing (CORS only needed for direct browser uploads)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Access Denied" when viewing receipts

**This was the original issue - now fixed with signed URLs!**

If you still see this error:
1. Verify your IAM policy includes `s3:GetObject` permission
2. Check that all 4 environment variables are set in Vercel
3. Ensure the bucket name and region match exactly
4. Redeploy your application after setting variables

### Error: "Access Denied" when uploading

**Cause**: IAM policy or credentials issue

**Solution**:
1. Verify the bucket name in your policy matches exactly
2. Check that environment variables are correct in Vercel
3. Ensure the IAM user has `s3:PutObject` permission
4. Redeploy your application

### Error: "Bucket Not Found"

**Cause**: Bucket name mismatch or wrong region

**Solution**:
1. Verify the bucket name is correct (no typos)
2. Check that the region matches your bucket's region
3. Bucket names are case-sensitive

### Error: "Invalid Credentials"

**Cause**: Wrong or expired access keys

**Solution**:
1. Go to IAM â†’ Users â†’ fuel-logbook-s3-user â†’ Security credentials
2. Deactivate old access key
3. Create new access key
4. Update environment variables in Vercel
5. Redeploy

### Signed URLs expire too quickly

**Default**: URLs expire after 1 hour

**To change**: Edit `lib/s3-client.ts` and modify the `expiresIn` parameter:
\`\`\`typescript
// Change from 3600 (1 hour) to desired seconds
const signedUrl = await getSignedUrlForObject(key, 7200) // 2 hours
\`\`\`

---

## Optional: CORS Configuration (Only if needed)

**Note**: CORS is NOT required for basic receipt viewing with signed URLs. Only configure CORS if you need direct browser uploads or other cross-origin requests.

If needed, add this CORS configuration to your bucket:

1. Go to S3 â†’ Your bucket â†’ Permissions â†’ CORS
2. Click "Edit"
3. Paste:

\`\`\`json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://your-app.vercel.app"],
    "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
\`\`\`

4. Replace `your-app.vercel.app` with your actual domain
5. Click "Save changes"

---

## Cost Considerations

- **S3 Storage**: First 50 TB / month: $0.023 per GB (Cape Town region)
- **PUT Requests**: $0.005 per 1,000 requests
- **GET Requests**: $0.0004 per 1,000 requests (includes signed URL generation)
- For a personal fuel logbook, costs should be minimal (< $1/month)

## Security Best Practices

### âœ… What's Implemented

- âœ… Private bucket (no public access)
- âœ… IAM user with minimal permissions
- âœ… Server-side encryption (SSE-S3)
- âœ… Signed URLs for temporary access
- âœ… Automatic URL expiration

### ðŸ”’ Additional Recommendations

1. **Rotate access keys** every 90 days
2. **Enable CloudTrail** to log all S3 access
3. **Set up S3 lifecycle rules** to archive old receipts
4. **Enable MFA** on your AWS root account
5. **Use custom policy** instead of AmazonS3FullAccess

---

## Next Steps

After completing this setup:

âœ… Your S3 bucket is configured with secure signed URLs
âœ… Receipts are stored privately and accessed securely
âœ… No "Access Denied" errors when viewing receipts
âœ… You can upload and view receipts in your Fuel Logbook app

**Optional enhancements:**
- Set up S3 lifecycle rules to archive old receipts to Glacier
